## Objective

To develop a vision-based generative AI system capable of real-time image analysis and intelligent recommendations, focused on safety, compliance, and process optimization in high-precision industrial environments such as pharmaceutical clean rooms.

---

## Key Goals

- Monitor operator behavior using ergonomic analysis for adherence to safety and regulatory standards.
- Detect anomalies (e.g., smoke or particulate presence) in clean rooms through image recognition.
- Generate real-time alerts and intelligent recommendations.
- Improve operational efficiency, safety, and regulatory compliance.
- Integrate AI-powered decision-making into existing industrial surveillance workflows.

## System Architecture

The proposed solution integrates the following modules:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time video feed from clean rooms.
2. **Pose Estimation**: Detect human posture and ergonomics.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify visual disturbances like smoke.
4. **Generative Inference**: Suggest actions or alerts based on detected behaviors or anomalies.
5. **Reporting Module**: Generate logs, alerts, and compliance reports in real-time.
